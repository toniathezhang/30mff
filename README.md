# 30mff


## Project Name: 

UNE|MP Convenience Store Tour Page by Tonia Zhang


## Project Description:



The webpage is created as part of the first assignment for Commlab summer 2020. The main idea was to create a webpage that would host the video for 30 minutes film festival and would correspond to the video's theme. During the time alloted for 30mff, our team (Tonia, Saad, Yusra, Romeno) did a convenience store tour inside our university, NYUAD. However, due to the lack of time for editing and other difficulties (being unfamiliar with video editing, camera quality) we ended up creating a meme video instead of a "legit" promotional video of campus life in NYUAD that could be put on the official website. Because of this, I changed my original idea of creating a mock website of a fake university called UNE|MP (full name: une|mployed, that mimics the formatting of the nyu|ad logo) that would have 99.9% similiarity in layout and etc with the official NYUAD website. Thus, I decided to create a "trashy" comical meme webpage to host the video. If the video is cringe, the webpage should be the same. That's what I think.


## Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.

I created a webpage divided into three sections: intro (with video and tag line), about, and actors. I did not want to make a manu since I thought it would be redundant since I did not have much parts. In order to navigate the user, though, I created an information button that is fixed on the page that redirects you to the "about" section, so that people will not feel lost. There are multiple interactive elements including flipcards, sound effects based on the location of your mouse, the info button. I guess the automatic slideshow does not count as interactive but it makes the page more "live" and interesting. 


## Reflection/Evaluation:

I am happy with the result, since I got a lot of knowledge about html, css, and js. Like some of the students of commlab, I've got no prior knowledge, but in the process I understood the basicsc of creating a website (and learning about how css is a pain in the feet). 
One problem that I was struggling with was to make the website look "bad in a good way". In other words, make it look stilistically bad and resembling of the websites from 2000s but still make it readable. I think I more-or-less achieved this goal.
Another problem was to make the website "responsive". After I used percentages, it solved the problem to the most extent.
One thing I have learned is to try not to blindly copy from w3schools, because you often have to install libraries& other good stuff, and that can mess up the code completely if you don't understand it. 
Also, I learned not to make too many divs. The cleaner, the better.
